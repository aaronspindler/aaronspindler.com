# Omas Coffee Design Brief

## Brand Overview

**Business Name:** Omas Coffee
**Type:** Premium coffee cart
**Tagline Options:**
- "Mit Erinnerung Gebraut" (Brewed with Memory)
- "Brewed with Memory"

## Brand Story

Omas Coffee honors the memory of the owner's German grandmother (Oma). The brand represents the warmth of German coffee tradition, specifically the afternoon "Kaffeezeit" ritual. Two personal elements are central: a gold butterfly that danced in Oma's kitchen window and a weathered walnut cutting board that witnessed generations of family gatherings.

## Visual Identity Requirements

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors:
- **Antique Gold:** `#d4af37` (primary accent)
- **Bright Gold:** `#f4d03f` (highlights)
- **Deep Walnut:** `#2c1810` (dark contrast)
- **Rich Walnut:** `#4a2c20` (medium brown)

#### Supporting Colors:
- **Deep Black:** `#0a0908` (for dark backgrounds)
- **Cream:** `#faf8f3` (light accent)
- **Soft Gold:** `#f5e6d3` (text on dark)

### Essential Design Elements

#### 1. Gold Butterfly Motif (Required)
- Represents Oma's memory
- Should appear elegant, not childish
- Can be subtle/abstract or literal

#### 2. Gothic "O" Initial
- Use Fraktur/Blackletter style for the "O" in "Omas"
- Rest of text can be modern sans-serif
- Creates German heritage connection

#### 3. Circular Badge Design
- Traditional German guild/establishment mark style
- Include "Gegründet 2025" or similar
- Double-ring border (classic German design)

### German Heritage Elements (Choose 1-2)
- Oak leaves (Eichenlaub) - subtle accents or framing
- Edelweiss flower - can complement butterfly
- Traditional ornamental flourishes (Bauernmalerei style)
- Subtle wood grain texture (representing walnut board)

### Logo Variations Needed

1. **Primary Logo** - Full design with text
2. **Secondary Mark** - Simplified icon (butterfly + coffee cup)
3. **Wordmark** - Text only version
4. **Badge/Seal Version** - For stamps, packaging

## Style Direction

- **Sophisticated & Elegant** - Not rustic or folksy
- **Modern with Heritage** - Contemporary execution of traditional elements
- **Premium Feel** - Should work on dark backgrounds
- **Emotional Warmth** - Honoring memory while welcoming customers

### Typography Guidelines

- **Primary:** Mix of Gothic (Fraktur) for "O" + clean sans-serif
- **Feel:** Elegant, readable, timeless
- **Avoid:** Overly ornate or hard-to-read scripts

## Applications

- Website (dark mode primary)
- Coffee packaging
- Signage
- Business cards
- Social media
- Coffee cups/merchandise

## Competitor Differentiation

Unlike typical coffee shops, Omas Coffee emphasizes:
- German coffee tradition (not Italian/American)
- Personal family heritage story
- "Gemütlichkeit" (cozy warmth and belonging)
- Afternoon coffee ritual vs. morning rush

## Emotional Goals

The logo should evoke:
- Nostalgia without being old-fashioned
- Warmth and welcome
- Premium quality with approachability
- Memory and tradition meeting modern craft

## Technical Requirements

- Vector format (AI, EPS, SVG)
- Work at small sizes (favicon) and large (signage)
- Strong silhouette for single-color applications
- Must work on both dark and light backgrounds

## Inspiration Keywords

German heritage, gold butterfly, walnut wood, family tradition, Kaffeekränzchen, afternoon light, warmth, memory, craftsmanship, Gemütlichkeit, premium coffee, European café culture

## What to Avoid

- Beer hall/Oktoberfest clichés
- Overly masculine/harsh German stereotypes
- Generic coffee shop imagery (beans, steam, etc.)
- Too playful or casual
- Cold or corporate feeling

## Special Note

The gold butterfly and walnut elements are deeply personal - they represent specific memories of the owner's grandmother. These should be treated with respect and elegance in the design.
