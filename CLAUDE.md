# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Django-based personal website and blog (aaronspindler.com) with advanced features including knowledge graph visualization, photo management, and analytics tracking.

## Directory Organization

The project root has been organized for clarity:

- **`deployment/`**: All Docker and deployment-related files (Dockerfiles, docker-compose, env files)
- **`.config/`**: Tool configuration files (PostCSS, PurgeCSS, Prettier, .dockerignore, .python-version)
- **`requirements/`**: Python dependencies using **uv lockfiles**:
  - **Source files** (`.in`): Direct dependencies only - edit these files
  - **Lockfiles** (`.txt`): Auto-generated with all dependencies pinned - never edit directly
  - `base.in` / `base.txt`: Production dependencies
  - `dev.in` / `dev.txt`: Development dependencies
- **Root directory**: Kept minimal with only essential files (manage.py, Makefile, package.json, captain-definition files)

**Important**: When referencing files in commands or documentation:
- Requirements: Install from `.txt` lockfiles, edit `.in` source files, regenerate with `uv pip compile`
- Docker: Use `deployment/Dockerfile` and `deployment/docker-compose.test.yml`
- Configs: PostCSS/PurgeCSS automatically find configs in `.config/` via explicit paths in build commands

## Cursor Rules

This project includes AI context rules in `.cursor/rules/` to guide development:
- **ai-context.mdc**: Guidelines for maintaining CLAUDE.md and README.md
- **comments.mdc**: Clean comment guidelines - no redundant references to previous implementations
- **dependencies.mdc**: Dependency management - only add direct dependencies to requirements files
- **documentation.mdc**: Documentation maintenance and update requirements
- **git-operations.mdc**: Git commit/push guidelines - always ask before committing or pushing
- **styling.mdc**: Blog post template styling guidelines
- **testing.mdc**: Testing guidelines and commands

**IMPORTANT**: Always reference these cursor rules along with CLAUDE.md when working on this codebase.
**CRITICAL**: When updating code or documentation, ensure comments focus on current implementation without references to what was replaced (see `.cursor/rules/comments.mdc`).
**CRITICAL**: When adding dependencies, only add packages that are directly imported/used in the codebase (see `.cursor/rules/dependencies.mdc`).
**CRITICAL**: Never commit or push changes without explicit user permission (see `.cursor/rules/git-operations.mdc`).

## Common Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install uv (first time only)
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from lockfile (10-100x faster than pip)
uv pip install -r requirements/base.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Collect static files (with optimization)
python manage.py collectstatic_optimize

# Run development server
python manage.py runserver

# Create superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Dependency Management with uv

```bash
# Add a new dependency
# 1. Edit requirements/base.in (add package with version)
# 2. Regenerate lockfile
uv pip compile requirements/base.in -o requirements/base.txt --generate-hashes

# Update all dependencies to latest compatible versions
uv pip compile --upgrade requirements/base.in -o requirements/base.txt --generate-hashes

# Update specific package
uv pip compile --upgrade-package django requirements/base.in -o requirements/base.txt --generate-hashes

# Install from lockfile (fast!)
uv pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Only edit `.in` source files, never `.txt` lockfiles
- Always regenerate lockfiles after modifying `.in` files
- Commit both `.in` and `.txt` files together
- **Dependabot PRs**: Lockfiles are automatically regenerated by the `dependabot-lockfile-regen.yml` workflow
- See `.cursor/rules/dependencies.mdc` for complete workflow

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests locally (without parallel execution)
python manage.py test

# Run tests with coverage locally (without parallel execution)
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test --no-input
coverage report

# Run tests in CI/CD with parallel execution
# Note: Only use --parallel flag in CI/CD environments, not locally
python manage.py test --parallel

# Security check
safety check
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do not write new tests for code in this repository unless explicitly requested.

### Makefile Commands

The project includes a Makefile for common development tasks:

```bash
# Static file management (default target)
make static         # Build CSS, optimize JS, collect/optimize static files, run pre-commit hooks
make css            # Build CSS only
make js             # Build and optimize JavaScript only
make collect        # Collect static files only
make clean          # Remove generated static files

# Docker testing commands
make test           # Run full test suite (build, run, cleanup)
make test-build     # Build Docker test images
make test-up        # Start test environment in background
make test-run       # Run all tests in Docker
make test-run-app APP=<app>    # Run tests for specific app
make test-shell     # Open shell in test container
make test-down      # Stop test environment
make test-clean     # Stop and remove test volumes
make test-coverage  # Run tests with coverage report

# Examples
make test-run-app APP=blog
make test-run-specific TEST=blog.tests.test_models
```

**Note**: The `make static` command is the primary way to rebuild static assets after CSS/JS changes. It automatically runs pre-commit hooks at the end.

### CSS and JavaScript Build
```bash
# Build and optimize CSS
npm run build:css

# Build CSS in development mode (unminified)
python manage.py build_css --dev

# Build critical CSS
npm run build:css:critical

# Build and minify JavaScript
npm run build:js

# Build all assets
npm run build:all
```

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever CSS or JS files are modified, you MUST run `make static` to rebuild and apply the changes. This command handles all necessary build steps to optimize and deploy static assets.

**CSS Build Process and Workflow**:
- **Source files** in `static/css/` (like `base.css`, `blog.css`, etc.) are **developer-friendly and formatted** in git
  - These files have proper line breaks, indentation, and whitespace for easy editing
  - Never commit minified/single-line CSS source files to git
  - Pre-commit hooks automatically format CSS with Prettier and prevent minified sources
- **Build process** (`python manage.py build_css`):
  - Phase 1: Optimizes each source file → creates temporary `.opt.css` versions
    - In dev mode (`--dev`): `.opt.css` files are just copies (no optimization)
    - In production: `.opt.css` files are fully optimized and minified
  - Phase 2: Combines all `.opt.css` files → runs PostCSS/PurgeCSS → creates `combined.min.css`
  - Final file is collected via `collectstatic_optimize` and served by WhiteNoise
  - Temporary files (`.opt.css`, `combined.css`, etc.) are auto-cleaned and gitignored
- **Important**: Source CSS files are **never modified** by the build process - they stay formatted in git

### Knowledge Graph Commands
```bash
# Rebuild knowledge graph cache
python manage.py rebuild_knowledge_graph

# Generate knowledge graph screenshot (high-quality, 2400x1600 at 2x DPI)
# For local development (Django server running on localhost:8000)
python manage.py generate_knowledge_graph_screenshot

# For production (screenshot the live site)
python manage.py generate_knowledge_graph_screenshot --url https://aaronspindler.com

# Custom URL (e.g., staging environment)
python manage.py generate_knowledge_graph_screenshot --url https://staging.example.com
```

**Note**: The screenshot generation command:
- Uses Pyppeteer/Chromium to take high-quality screenshots (2400x1600, 2x device scale factor)
- Runs automatically via Celery Beat daily at 4 AM UTC (screenshots production site)
- Stores screenshots in the database with hash-based caching to avoid duplicates
- Defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for local development

### Photo Management
```bash
# Generate photo album zips
python manage.py generate_album_zips
```

### Lighthouse Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit and store results
python manage.py run_lighthouse_audit

# Run audit for a specific URL
python manage.py run_lighthouse_audit --url https://example.com

# Setup daily automated audits (Celery Beat)
python manage.py setup_periodic_tasks
```

### Cache Management
```bash
# Clear all caches
python manage.py clear_cache

# Setup periodic tasks (for Celery)
python manage.py setup_periodic_tasks
```

### Search Index Management
```bash
# Rebuild full-text search index for all content
python manage.py rebuild_search_index

# Rebuild only blog posts
python manage.py rebuild_search_index --content-type blog

# Rebuild only photos
python manage.py rebuild_search_index --content-type photos

# Rebuild only photo albums
python manage.py rebuild_search_index --content-type albums

# Clear and rebuild entire index
python manage.py rebuild_search_index --clear

# Example: Clear and rebuild only blog posts
python manage.py rebuild_search_index --clear --content-type blog
```

**Note**: The search index should be rebuilt whenever:
- New blog posts are added
- Blog post content is significantly modified
- New photos or albums are added
- Project or book data changes

### Security & Request Tracking
```bash
# Geolocate IP addresses for RequestFingerprint records
python manage.py geolocate_fingerprints

# Limit number of records to process
python manage.py geolocate_fingerprints --limit 100

# Re-geolocate all records (including those with existing geo data)
python manage.py geolocate_fingerprints --force

# Custom batch size (default: 100 IPs per batch)
python manage.py geolocate_fingerprints --batch-size 50

# Skip confirmation prompt (for automated runs via cron/Celery)
python manage.py geolocate_fingerprints --yes

# Remove local/private IP request fingerprints
python manage.py remove_local_fingerprints

# Preview which records would be deleted (dry-run mode)
python manage.py remove_local_fingerprints --dry-run

# Limit number of records to delete
python manage.py remove_local_fingerprints --limit 100
```

**Note**: The `geolocate_fingerprints` command uses ip-api.com free tier:
- Single endpoint: 45 requests/minute
- Batch endpoint: 15 requests/minute (100 IPs per batch)
- IP addresses are automatically filtered to exclude local/private IPs
- Geolocation data includes: city, country, coordinates, timezone, ISP, etc.
- Shows statistics before processing (total records vs unique IPs)
- Waits for Enter key confirmation before proceeding (skip with --yes)
- Run periodically (e.g., via cron or Celery Beat) to batch process new records
- Geolocation is NOT performed during request processing to avoid latency

**Note**: The `remove_local_fingerprints` command removes historical local/private IP records:
- Local IPs: 127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost
- Private ranges: 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x
- Middleware now automatically skips tracking local requests
- Use `--dry-run` to preview deletions before committing
- Useful for one-time cleanup after deploying local IP filtering

  - Separate website served via domain routing middleware
  - Independent URL routing and templates
  - Coffee-themed design and branding
  - Homepage with feature showcase

### Multi-Domain Support

The application uses custom middleware (`config/domain_routing.py`) to serve multiple websites from a single Django project:

**How It Works**:
- `DomainRoutingMiddleware` inspects the request hostname
- Maps specific domains to their corresponding URL configurations
- Falls back to `config.urls` (main site) for unmapped domains

**Configuration** (`config/domain_routing.py`):
```python
domain_mapping = {
    "omas.coffee": "omas.urls",
    "www.omas.coffee": "omas.urls",
}
```

**Settings** (`config/settings.py`):
- Middleware: `DomainRoutingMiddleware` must be first in the middleware stack
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Must include all domains to be served
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: Must include all trusted domain origins

**Adding New Domains**:
1. Create a new Django app for the domain
2. Add app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py
3. Add domain mapping to `config/domain_routing.py`
4. Add domain to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in settings.py
5. Create URL configuration (`urls.py`) and views for the new domain
6. Create templates for the new domain
7. Deploy and configure DNS to point to the application

**Local Development**:
- Use `/etc/hosts` to map domains to localhost for testing
- Example: Add `127.0.0.1 omas.coffee` to `/etc/hosts` to test omas.coffee locally
- Access via `http://omas.coffee:8000` when running `python manage.py runserver`

### Key Technical Features

1. **Knowledge Graph System** (`blog/knowledge_graph.py`)
   - Builds interactive graph from blog post metadata
   - Uses Pyppeteer for server-side screenshot generation
   - Caching system for performance
   - LinkParser class for extracting internal/external links
   - GraphBuilder for constructing graph structures
   - **Visualization Enhancements** (October 2024):
     - Adaptive force simulation parameters based on node count
     - Velocity limiting to prevent jitter (max velocity: 10)
     - Improved collision detection with 1.0x radius for blog posts
     - Golden angle distribution for category positioning
     - Grid layout for large category groups (8+ nodes)
     - Stabilization phase when alpha < 0.1
     - Maximum iteration limit (500 ticks) to prevent infinite running

2. **Static File Optimization**
   - Custom `collectstatic_optimize` command with image compression
   - CSS build pipeline with PostCSS, PurgeCSS, and critical CSS extraction
   - JavaScript minification with Terser
   - Brotli compression for static assets
   - WhiteNoise for serving static files (CSS, JS, fonts) from container

3. **Blog Post System**
   - HTML templates as blog posts
   - Metadata extraction from templates
   - View count tracking per post
   - Category-based organization
   - Template normalization for consistency
   - **Important**: When modifying blog post templates in `templates/blog/*/*.html`, utilize existing stylesheets and maintain consistency with other posts

4. **Full-Text Search System** (`utils/search.py`, `utils/models/search.py`)
   - PostgreSQL-powered full-text search with trigram similarity for typo tolerance
   - SearchableContent model (in utils app) stores indexed content from blog posts, projects, and books
   - Photo and PhotoAlbum models have search_vector fields with GIN indexes
   - Search features:
     - Full-text search using SearchVector, SearchQuery, and SearchRank
     - Trigram similarity (pg_trgm extension) for typo-tolerant matching
     - Combined scoring: 70% FTS rank + 30% trigram similarity
     - Relevance thresholds: rank > 0.01 OR similarity > 0.2
     - Weighted fields: title (A), description (B), content (C)
   - Frontend autocomplete already implemented:
     - Vanilla JavaScript in `/static/js/search-autocomplete.js`
     - Triggers after 2 characters typed
     - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
     - API endpoint: `/api/search/autocomplete/`
   - Management command: `rebuild_search_index` (in utils app) to populate/update search index
   - **Performance**: Sub-100ms response time for autocomplete queries

### Deployment Configuration
- **Docker**: Optimized build with Pyppeteer for screenshot generation (~800MB image size)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with psycopg3
- **Storage**:
  - Static files (CSS, JS, fonts): WhiteNoise (served from container)
  - Media files (photos, uploads): AWS S3 via django-storages
- **Server**: Gunicorn with 8 workers
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and sessions
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables (use django-environ):
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DEBUG`: Debug mode flag
- AWS credentials (required for production media storage; optional for local development):
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`
  - `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME` (optional, defaults to us-east-1)
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL (for caching)
- `USE_DEV_CACHE_PREFIX`: Prefix cache keys with 'dev_' for local development (optional, defaults to False)
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL`: Celery broker URL (defaults to REDIS_URL)
- `RESUME_ENABLED`: Enable resume download feature
- `RESUME_FILENAME`: Resume file name

### Blog Post Template Structure
Blog posts are HTML templates in `templates/blog/<category>/<filename>.html` with metadata:
```html
{% block meta_description %}Post description{% endblock %}
{% block meta_title %}Post Title{% endblock %}
{% block meta_publish_date %}YYYY-MM-DD{% endblock %}
{% block meta_post_type %}Category{% endblock %}
{% block meta_reading_time %}X{% endblock %}
```

### Code Block Formatting in Blog Posts

**IMPORTANT**: Blog posts use Prism.js for syntax highlighting. Always format code blocks as follows:

#### Multi-line Code Blocks
```html
<pre><code class="language-python">
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
```

#### Supported Languages
Common language classes (use `language-{name}` format):
- `language-python` - Python code
- `language-bash` - Bash/shell commands
- `language-javascript` or `language-js` - JavaScript
- `language-html` - HTML markup
- `language-css` - CSS styles
- `language-sql` - SQL queries
- `language-json` - JSON data
- `language-text` - Plain text output

#### Inline Code
For inline code within paragraphs, use simple `<code>` tags:
```html
<p>Use the <code>manage.py</code> command to run migrations.</p>
```

#### Technical Notes
- Prism.js automatically adds syntax highlighting with line numbers
- Copy-to-clipboard button appears on hover
- The site's CSS overrides Prism colors to match the theme
- **DO NOT** add custom borders, backgrounds, or margins to code elements - let Prism handle the layout

### Testing Approach
- Django's built-in test framework
- Parallel test execution supported (CI/CD only, not for local development)
- Test files organized in app-specific `tests/` directories
- Coverage reporting with coverage.py
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL service container

#### Docker Test Environment
The project includes a comprehensive Docker-based test environment (`docker-compose.test.yml`):
- **Services**: Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Flower, Localstack (S3 emulation)
- **Configuration**: `env.test` for test-specific environment variables
- **Test runner**: Dedicated container for running tests with `config.settings_test`
- **Benefits**: Isolated test environment matching production setup
- **Usage**: Use `make test` commands (see Makefile Commands section above)
- **Note**: Test environment uses Localstack for S3 testing (no AWS credentials needed)

### Security and Code Quality
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Automated security scanning runs on:
  - Every push to main
  - All pull requests
  - Daily scheduled scans at 5:30 AM UTC
  - Scans both Python and JavaScript code
  - Uses `security-and-quality` query suite (comprehensive security + code quality checks)

- **GitHub Copilot Autofix**: Provides AI-powered fix suggestions for CodeQL alerts
  - Available for public repositories (free with GitHub Advanced Security)
  - **How it works**:
    - CodeQL runs on pull requests and detects security/quality issues in the PR's code changes
    - Copilot Autofix automatically analyzes new alerts and suggests fixes as PR comments
    - Developers can review and apply suggested fixes with one click
  - **Important**: Copilot Autofix only works for **new alerts detected in PR code changes**, not existing alerts on main branch
  - **Manual fix generation**: For existing alerts on main branch:
    1. Go to repository Security tab → Code scanning alerts
    2. Click on an alert to view details
    3. Click "Generate fix" button to get AI-powered fix suggestions
    4. Review and apply the suggested fix manually
  - Requires GitHub Advanced Security enabled (automatic for public repos)

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local code quality enforcement (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
  - **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
    - `ruff` hook: Linting with auto-fixing for Python code (replaces flake8, isort)
    - `ruff-format` hook: Code formatting (Black-compatible)
    - Configuration in `pyproject.toml`
  - **Prettier**: CSS formatting for source files only
    - Formats developer-friendly CSS files in `static/css/`
    - Excludes generated/optimized CSS files (`.opt.css`, `combined.*.css`, etc.)
  - **CSS Format Checker**: Custom script to prevent minified CSS from being committed
    - Script: `scripts/check-css-format.sh`
    - Ensures source CSS files remain developer-friendly
  - **File Quality Checks**: Standard pre-commit hooks
    - Trailing whitespace removal
    - End-of-file fixer
    - YAML validation
    - Large file checker (max 1MB)
    - Merge conflict checker
  - **Setup**: Run `pre-commit install` after cloning the repository
  - **Usage**: Automatically runs on `git commit`, or run manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - **Note**: The `make static` command automatically runs pre-commit hooks at the end

### Code Style Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)

The project uses Ruff for linting and formatting, configured in `pyproject.toml`:

**General Settings**:
- Line length: 120 characters
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Excludes: migrations, venv, staticfiles, node_modules, third-party projects

**Linting Rules**:
- Enabled: pycodestyle (E/W), pyflakes (F), isort (I)
- Ignored: E501 (line too long, handled by formatter)

**Formatting**:
- Black-compatible formatter
- Double quotes for strings
- Space indentation
- Auto line-ending detection

**Per-File Ignores**:
- Test files: Allow star imports (F403, F405), unused variables (F841)
- `__init__.py`: Allow unused imports (F401)
- Admin files: Allow bare except clauses (E722) for display methods
- Build commands: Allow unused subprocess results (F841)
- Settings/utils: Allow module-level imports not at top (E402)

**Import Sorting**:
- First-party packages: accounts, blog, pages, photos, utils, config
- Order: future → standard-library → third-party → first-party → local-folder

### Prettier Configuration (`.prettierrc`)

CSS formatting is managed by Prettier with the following settings:
- Print width: 120 characters
- Tab width: 2 spaces
- Semi-colons: Required
- Quotes: Double quotes
- Trailing commas: ES5 style
- Line endings: LF (Unix-style)

**Note**: Only source CSS files in `static/css/` are formatted by Prettier. Generated/optimized CSS files (`.opt.css`, `combined.*.css`, etc.) are excluded via `.prettierignore`.

### Performance Optimizations
- Graph data caching with 20-minute timeout
- File modification time tracking for cache invalidation
- Multi-resolution image generation (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- Static file compression and optimization
- Database query optimization with select/prefetch related
- PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes
- Trigram indexes for typo-tolerant search

   - Update existing feature docs for enhancements
   - Add to README.md features list with doc link
   - Update `docs/architecture.md` if new Django app or architectural change

2. **Adding Management Commands**:
   - Add command to `docs/commands.md` with full reference (usage, options, examples, when to run)
   - Update README.md common commands if frequently used

3. **Modifying APIs**:
   - Update `docs/api.md` with new/modified endpoints
   - Include request/response examples
   - Document new query parameters or body fields

4. **Changing Configuration**:
   - Update relevant docs with new environment variables
   - Document in `docs/deployment.md`
   - Update `.env.example` if needed

5. **Deployment Changes**:
   - Update `docs/deployment.md` for infrastructure changes

   - Add migration guide if needed
   - Update README.md if affects quick start

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple language, avoid jargon
- **Examples**: Include practical code examples for all features
- **Commands**: Show actual commands users can copy/paste
- **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation
- **Professional Tone**: Technical but approachable

See `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc` for complete documentation guidelines, templates, and standards.

### Verification Before PR

Before completing ANY pull request, verify:

- [ ] README.md updated if new feature or breaking change
- [ ] Feature-specific doc created/updated in `docs/features/`
- [ ] `docs/commands.md` updated if new management command added
- [ ] `docs/api.md` updated if API endpoints added/modified
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` updated if new app or architectural change
- [ ] `docs/deployment.md` updated if deployment process changes
- [ ] Examples tested and working
- [ ] Cross-references checked and valid
- [ ] No broken links in documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Code changes without documentation updates will be rejected. Documentation is not optional—it's a core part of every feature.

## Final Notes

- Always reference the cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` when working on this codebase
- Keep CLAUDE.md and README.md synchronized with code changes (see `.cursor/rules/ai-context.mdc`)
- **Update `docs/` directory whenever code changes** (see `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc`)
- **Write clean, forward-looking comments** without references to replaced implementations (see `.cursor/rules/comments.mdc`)
- Use `make static` after CSS/JS changes to rebuild assets
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing (or use graphite which auto-runs hooks)
- Dont run tests locally
