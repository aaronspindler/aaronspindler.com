As well as the general forms `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` more specific forms such as `assertGreaterEquals()` and `assertNotIn()` are provided. By using the more specific forms it is possible to get more precise and informative failure messages in the event of a test failing. This can speed up the debugging process.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nReplace all calls to `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` that do not provide a custom failure message with a more specific variant. Alternatively, provide a tailored failure message using the `assertTrue(condition, message)` form.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` are used.\n\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\n\nclass MyTest(TestCase):\n    \n    \n    def testInts(self):\n        self.assertTrue(1 == 1)\n        self.assertFalse(1 \u003e 2)\n        self.assertTrue(1 in []) #This will fail\n\n```\nThis will make it more difficult to determine what has gone wrong when `self.assertTrue(1 in [])` fails. The failure message \"AssertionError: False is not true\" is not very helpful.\n\nA more useful error message can be generated by changing the asserts to the more specific forms as in the following example.\n\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\n\nclass MyTest(TestCase):\n    \n    \n    def testInts(self):\n        self.assertEqual(1, 1)\n        self.assertLessEqual(1, 2)\n        self.assertIn(1, []) #This will fail\n\n```\nIn this case, the failure message \"AssertionError: 1 not found in \\[\\]\" is much more informative.\n\n\n## References\n* Python library reference: [TestCase.assertEqual](https://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual).\n","id":"py/imprecise-assert","name":"py/imprecise-assert","severity":"note","tags":["maintainability","quality","readability"]},"state":"open","tool":{"guid":null,"name":"CodeQL","version":"2.23.2"},"updated_at":"2025-10-15T01:28:22Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aaronspindler/aaronspindler.com/code-scanning/alerts/381"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2025-10-15T00:21:08Z","dismissal_approved_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"fixed_at":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronspindler/aaronspindler.com/security/code-scanning/380","instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aaronspindler/aaronspindler.com/code-scanning/alerts/380/instances","most_recent_instance":{"analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql.yml:analyze","category":"/language:python","classifications":[],"commit_sha":"47da785375462a7732866815cbb46d7ac50e291c","environment":"{\"language\":\"python\"}","location":{"end_column":9,"end_line":5,"path":"accounts/models.py","start_column":5,"start_line":5},"message":{"text":"Unnecessary 'pass' statement."},"ref":"refs/heads/main","state":"open"},"number":380,"rule":{"description":"Unnecessary pass","full_description":"Unnecessary 'pass' statement","help":"# Unnecessary pass\nA `pass` statement is only necessary when it is the only statement in a block (the list of statements forming part of a compound statement).

As well as the general forms `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` more specific forms such as `assertGreaterEquals()` and `assertNotIn()` are provided. By using the more specific forms it is possible to get more precise and informative failure messages in the event of a test failing. This can speed up the debugging process.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nReplace all calls to `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` that do not provide a custom failure message with a more specific variant. Alternatively, provide a tailored failure message using the `assertTrue(condition, message)` form.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` are used.\n\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\n\nclass MyTest(TestCase):\n    \n    \n    def testInts(self):\n        self.assertTrue(1 == 1)\n        self.assertFalse(1 \u003e 2)\n        self.assertTrue(1 in []) #This will fail\n\n```\nThis will make it more difficult to determine what has gone wrong when `self.assertTrue(1 in [])` fails.
