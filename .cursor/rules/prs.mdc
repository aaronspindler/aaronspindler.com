# Pull Request Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Always ask the user for permission before creating commits or pushing to source control, even when using MCP or Graphite tools.

After receiving permission and completing all changes:
1. Create a PR for the branch if one doesn't exist
2. If a PR already exists for the branch, update it with the changes
