# Testing Guidelines

## Important: Do NOT Write New Tests

**CRITICAL**: Do not write new tests for code in this repository unless explicitly requested by the user.

This guideline is specified in the project's CLAUDE.md and should be followed strictly.

## When to Update Existing Tests

You SHOULD update existing tests when:
- Modifying code that has test coverage
- Changing function signatures or behavior
- Fixing bugs that have test cases
- Refactoring code with existing tests

## Test Writing Guidelines

If explicitly asked to write tests:
- Do not test frameworks or libraries - only test the code in this repository
- Be as concise as possible when writing tests
- Ensure edge cases are tested
- Utilize factories to create test data
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase

## Test Assertion Guidelines

Prefer named variables for each parameter in assertions:

**Don't Do:**
```python
self.assertEqual(test_result.get_count(), 10, "Expecting 10")
```

**Do:**
```python
actual = test_result.get_count()
expected = 10
message = f"Found {actual} expected {expected}"
self.assertEqual(actual, expected, message)
```

## Running Tests

Run tests using:
```bash
make test
```

This command runs the Django test suite without parallel execution (suitable for local development).

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT run tests** unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Do NOT write new tests** unless explicitly requested by the user
- When modifying existing code, always check for corresponding tests and update them to reflect changes
