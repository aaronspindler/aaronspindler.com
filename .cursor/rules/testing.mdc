# Testing Guidelines

## Running Tests

Run tests using:
```bash
make test
```

This command runs the Django test suite without parallel execution (suitable for local development).

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT write new tests** unless explicitly requested by the user
- When modifying existing code, always check for corresponding tests and update them to reflect changes
- Tests should be run locally without the `--parallel` flag
- The `--parallel` flag is only used in CI/CD environments
