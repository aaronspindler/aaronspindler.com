Do not try to write tests for code in this repository.

When running tests locally, do not use the --parallel flag. Run tests with:
- `python manage.py test` (without --parallel)
- `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test --no-input` (without --parallel)

The --parallel flag should only be used in CI/CD environments, not for local development.
