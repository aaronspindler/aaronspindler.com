<h1>Building <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a>: A Treadmill-Powered Journey in One Week</h1>

<img src="{% static 'images/actionsuptime_walking.jpg' %}" alt="Workouts">

<p>Ever wondered what happens when you combine a crazy idea, a treadmill, and a week of intense coding? Well, buckle up, because I'm about to take you on a wild ride through my journey of building <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a> while walking on a treadmill in just one week!</p>

<h2>The Inception</h2>
<p>It all started with a simple thought: "I have all of these uptime monitors on my websites, but I don't really have a good way to monitor my github actions (which I use for all of my projects, and I have many of them)"</p>
<p>I also just got a walking pad, so I thought it would be a fun experiment to see if I could build something while walking on the treadmill.</p>

<h2>Day 1-2: Setting Up and Planning</h2>
<p>The first two days were all about setting up the site. I need auth, hosting, a domain, a database, and some way to monitor github actions. I decided to use postgres for the database, and django for the framework. I even setup a <a href="https://github.com/aaronspindler/base_app">repo to use as a building block</a> for future projects.</p>

<h2>Day 3-4: Core Functionality</h2>
<p>By day three, I was finding my rhythm - both in walking and coding. I implemented the core functionality of <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a>, including API integrations with GitHub and data processing logic. The constant movement seemed to keep my mind sharp and focused.</p>

<h2>Day 5-6: User Interface and Testing</h2>
<p>As I entered the latter half of the week, I was practically dancing on the treadmill. I designed and implemented the user interface, making sure it was responsive and user-friendly. I also wrote and ran tests, all while clocking in miles on my treadmill.</p>

<h2>Day 7: Polishing and Launching</h2>
<p>On the final day, with sore legs but a clear mind, I put the finishing touches on <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a>. I optimized performance, added some ways to be notified when actions fail, and finally hit the 'deploy' button. The sense of accomplishment was doubled - not only had I built a useful tool, but I'd also walked a marathon's worth of steps!</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>By the end of the week, I had:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Built a fully functional version of <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a></li>
    <li>Walked almost 20KM</li>
    <li>Improved my focus and productivity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This experiment taught me that movement and coding can go hand in hand. The constant low-intensity exercise kept me alert and focused, leading to more productive coding sessions. It also reinforced the importance of taking breaks and staying active, even when deep in a project.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>After the success of this experiment, I'm considering making the treadmill desk a permanent fixture in my workspace. As for <a href="https://ActionsUptime.com">ActionsUptime.com</a>, I'm excited to continue developing and improving it. Who knows, maybe the next feature will be built while cycling!</p>

<p>Remember, innovation doesn't just happen in your mind - sometimes, it takes a few steps in the right direction. So, why not give it a try? Your next big project might just be a walk away!</p>
