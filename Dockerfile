# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
# Optimized for CI/CD with fastest possible build times
#
# Uses Microsoft's Playwright Python image (includes Python + Playwright + Chromium)
# BuildKit cache mounts for pip, npm, and apt packages
#
# Performance:
#   - First build: ~2-3 minutes (vs 8 minutes with slim base)
#   - Rebuild with code changes: ~30-60 seconds
#   - Rebuild with dependencies: ~1-2 minutes
#
# Trade-off: Larger base image (~1.5GB) but optimized for CI/CD speed
# See DOCKER_BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md for details
