## Brand Overview

**Business Name:** Omas Coffee
**Type:** Premium coffee cart
**Official Tagline:** "Mit Erinnerung Gebraut" (Brewed with Memory)
**Established:** 2025 (Gegründet 2025)

---

## Brand Story

Omas Coffee honors the memory of the owner's German grandmother (Oma). The brand represents the warmth of German coffee tradition, specifically the afternoon "Kaffeezeit" ritual—a cherished 3-4 PM pause where families gather for coffee, cake, and meaningful conversation. Unlike the rushed morning coffee, Kaffeezeit is about slowing down, connecting, and savoring both the moment and the memories being made.

Two deeply personal elements anchor our visual identity:
- **The Gold Butterfly:** A delicate visitor that would dance in Oma's kitchen window during afternoon coffee, becoming a symbol of fleeting yet precious moments
- **The Walnut Cutting Board:** A weathered family heirloom that witnessed generations of Streuselkuchen preparation and countless family gatherings

---

## Brand Promise

We promise to create a moment of "Gemütlichkeit"—that untranslatable German feeling of warmth, belonging, and contentment—in every cup. Our coffee cart isn't just a place to grab caffeine; it's a traveling piece of home where tradition meets modern craft, where every customer becomes part of our extended family story.
